    <h2>Headings Are Great Fun</h2>
    <p>This is my <strong>first paragraph</strong> in my new webpage. This is going to be great. I am so excited I can hardly contain <em>myself</em>. Don't you just love paragraphs? I find them very useful.</p>
    
    <h2>Web Pages Are Exciting Too</h2>
    <p>Yes, that's right - web pages can be a lot of fun. Learning how to create web pages is <em>easy</em> and <strong>entertaining</strong>. This is my <strong>second paragraph</strong>. I hope you like it.</p>
